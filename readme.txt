1. ENEM (National High School Exam) is a test and it's used to evaluate the quality of basic education in Brazil.
2. This is a study of a very large database, in which we try to predict the grade of students, who sign up for ENEM 2012, based on various attributes of the database, such as type of school (private or public), where they live (rural or urban areas), and etc.
3. In each folder, different attributes are selected to predict the grade.
